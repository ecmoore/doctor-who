                                	<p>The Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was  portrayed by Colin Baker. Although his televisual time on the series was  comparatively brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in  Big Finish's range of original Doctor Who audio adventures. Within the series' narrative,  the Doctor is a centuries-old Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who  travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the  Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body; in doing so, his  physical appearance and personality change. Baker portrays the sixth such  incarnation, a flamboyant man in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose  brash and overbearing personality set him apart from all his previous  incarnations, at times hearkening back to the early irascibility and initial  undertones of untrustworthiness of the First Doctor.</p>
							<p>The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons. His appearance  in the first of these was at the end of the final episode of The Caves of  Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and thereafter  in the following serial The Twin Dilemma, the end of that season. The Sixth  Doctor's era was marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to  put the series on an 18-month &quot;hiatus&quot; between seasons 22 and 23, with  only one new Doctor Who story, Slipback, made on radio during the hiatus,  broadcast as 6 parts (at 10 minutes each) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8  August 1985, as part of a children's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four.  Colin Baker had been signed up for four years,[1] as the previous actor Peter  Davison had left after only three years.</p>
