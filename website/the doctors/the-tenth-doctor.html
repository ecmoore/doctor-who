							<h2> David Tennant </h2>
                                	<p>The Tenth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is  played by Scottish actor David Tennant, who appears in three series as well as  eight specials. As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has  also appeared in other Doctor Who multimedia.</p>
							<p>In the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old Time  Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time in his TARDIS,  frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can  regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change.  Tennant portrays the tenth such incarnation. This incarnation's companions have  included working class shop assistant Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), medical  student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) and fiery temp worker Donna Noble  (Catherine Tate); he eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008  series finale, &quot;Journey's End&quot;, after which he attempted to travel  alone for the duration of the 2008â€“10 specials.</p>
							<p>In November 2013, as part of Doctor Who's 50th Anniversary  celebrations, Tennant's Doctor was voted &quot;The UK's favourite Doctor&quot;  in a survey held by the Radio Times magazine.</p>
