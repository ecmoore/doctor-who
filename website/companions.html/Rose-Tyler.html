                                	<h1>Rose Tyler</h1>
                                	<p>.Rose Tyler is a fictional character portrayed by Billie  Piper in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who,  and was created by series producer Russell T Davies. With the revival of Doctor  Who in 2005, Rose was introduced in the eponymous series one premiere as a new  companion of series protagonist the Doctor, in his ninth and tenth  incarnations. The companion character, intended to act as an audience  surrogate, was key in the first series more so than any other to introduce new  viewers to Doctor Who, which had not aired regularly since 1989. The series saw  Billie Piper receive top billing alongside Christopher Eccleston and David  Tennant, both of whom portrayed the Doctor. A regular companion of the Doctor  for all of series one and series two, Rose also returned in the programme's  fourth series having developed into a harder character.</p>
