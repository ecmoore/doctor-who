			<h1>Welcome to the Doctor Who Site</h1>
			<p>Doctor Who is a British science-fiction television programme  produced by the BBC. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord—a  time-travelling humanoid alien known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in  his TARDIS (acronym: Time and Relative Dimension in Space), a sentient  time-travelling space ship. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box,  which was a common sight in Britain  in 1963 when the series first aired. Along with a succession of companions, the  Doctor faces a variety of foes while working to save civilisations, help  ordinary people, and right wrongs.</p>
			<p>The show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest  television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for  Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National  Television Awards during Russell T Davies's tenure as executive producer.[2][3]  In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA  Television Award for Best Actor. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured Doctor  Who with an Institutional Peabody &quot;for evolving with technology and the  times like nothing else in the known television universe.&quot;[4] The  programme is listed in Guinness World Records as the longest-running science  fiction television show in the world[5] and as the &quot;most successful&quot;  science fiction series of all time—based on its over-all broadcast ratings, DVD  and book sales, and iTunes traffic.[6] During its original run, it was  recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects,  and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC  Radiophonic Workshop).		</p>
