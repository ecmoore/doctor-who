			<h1>The Doctors</h1>
			<p><IMG src="http://www.doctor-who-toys.com/images-files/doctors.jpg" alt=""></p>
			<p>The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in  mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he  was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice  while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the  &quot;TARDIS&quot; (an acronym for Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space),  which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality  referred to as &quot;dimensionally transcendental&quot;).[note 4][81]</p>
			<p>The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly  mellowed into a more compassionate figure. It was eventually revealed that he  had been on the run from his own people, the Time Lords of the planet Gallifrey.</p>
