                                	<p>Clara Oswald is a fictional character portrayed by  Jenna-Louise Coleman in the long-running British science fiction television  series Doctor Who. First appearing in the show's seventh series, Clara is  introduced as a companion of the eleventh incarnation of the alien time  traveller known as the Doctor (portrayed by Matt Smith).</p>
							<p>Clara is presented to the audience as during the first half  of the seventh series as three distinct though similarly named people living in  distant eras of time. The first two incarnations each die during the episode in  which they appear, while the third becomes the Doctor's full-time companion,  travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the  mystery of her multiple lives. Coleman is expected to stay in the role for at  least another series,[1] alongside the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi).[2]</p>
