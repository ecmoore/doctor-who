                                	<h1>River Song</h1>
                                	<p>River Song is a fictional character created by Steven Moffat  and played by Alex Kingston in the British science-fiction series Doctor Who.  River Song was introduced to the series as an experienced future companion of  series protagonist the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time in  his TARDIS. Because River Song is a time traveller herself, her adventures with  the Doctor occur out of synchronisation; their first meeting (from the  audience's perspective) is his first and apparently her last. In later  appearances, River is a companion of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation,  portrayed by Matt Smith. River Song was created by Doctor Who writer Steven  Moffat for the show's fourth series in 2008, under the tenure of executive  producer Russell T Davies. When Moffat took over Davies' duties as executive  producer, he began expanding on the character's background, depicting  adventures earlier in River's timeline, upgrading Alex Kingston from a guest  star to a recurring actor in the series. Other actresses have subsequently  portrayed younger versions of the character.</p>
