							<h2>Sylvester McCoy </h2>
                                	<p>The Seventh Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is  portrayed by Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy.</p>
							<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old  Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality  change. McCoy portrays the seventh such incarnation, a whimsical, thoughtful  character who quickly becomes more layered, secretive, and manipulative. His  first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer programmer who  travelled with his previous incarnation, and who is soon succeeded by troubled  teenager and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his protégée.</p>
