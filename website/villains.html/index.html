Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the  Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the  Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special.[95] Since  its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen  (Raxacoricofallapatorian), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.</p>
