                                	<p>The Weeping Angels are an ancient race of aliens from the  long running sci fi series Doctor Who. Steven Moffat, their creator, attributes  their appeal to childhood games such as Grandmother's Footsteps and the notion  that every statue is secretly a Weeping Angel.[1]</p>
							<p>Their usual mode of feeding is to send their victims back in  time, which creates time energy to feed on. When they are not being observed by  another being, they can move very quickly and silently, but when they are being  observed, they become &quot;quantum-locked&quot;, occupying a single position  in space and becoming stone. In this state, they are frozen and difficult to  destroy. They cannot suppress this reaction. If two Weeping Angels were to look  at each other at the same time, they would be trapped in stone form until an  outside force moves them apart. To prevent this, they often cover their eyes  while moving, which makes them look as though they are weeping.                                </p>
