                                	<p>The Ninth Doctor first encountered Cassandra (Lady Cassandra  O'Brien.Î”17) in the episode &quot;The End of the World&quot;. They, along with  the rich and powerful of the universe, were on Platform One, a space station  orbiting Earth five billion years in the future, which was set up to witness  the final destruction of the planet by the expansion of the Sun.</p>
							<p>According to Cassandra, her parents were the last to be  buried &quot;in its soil&quot;. She had been born on Earth and lived on the  edge of the &quot;Los Angeles Crevasse&quot;. Cassandra referred to herself as  being &quot;a boy&quot; during this time. This could imply she was transgender;  however, it may also be possible that the term &quot;boy&quot; in the  contemporary vernacular may have lost its gender significance and come to mean  simply &quot;child&quot;. Married several times, her life had been extended  through a series of 708 plastic surgery operations, until she was nothing but a  piece of skin stretched onto a frame, with eyes and a mouth, connected to a  brain in a designer jar filled with a preserving solution below. The skin had  to be constantly moisturised to keep it from drying out. As the rest of the human  race had long since either interbred with other intelligent species or altered  themselves to the point even they don't call themselves human anymore  (references are made to 'New Humans', 'Proto-humans' and 'Digi-humans'),  Cassandra considered herself the last &quot;pure&quot; human, and all others as  'mongrels'. Rose Tyler, who was quickly turned off by her arrogance,  characterised her as a &quot;bitchy trampoline&quot; and referred to her as  &quot;Michael Jackson&quot;.</p>
