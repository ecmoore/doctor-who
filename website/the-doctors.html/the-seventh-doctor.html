		<td><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Content Area" -->[The TARDIS is attacked by villainous Time Lady the Rani, triggering the Doctor&rsquo;s next regeneration. His Seventh body was both a spoon-playing clown and a master of deep dark secrets. He toppled empires in a single night, entertained in the circus of the Gods of Ragnarok and played chess with the ancient and evil Fenric. Despite telling Ace that they still had &ldquo;work to do&rdquo; as they strode away from her home town of Perivale, it was in this incarnation that the television series was rested. The Seventh Doctor went on to have many adventures in books, comic strips and on audio. He returned on the eve of the millennium to transport the remains of the Master back to Gallifrey. Emerging from the TARDIS, he was shot by a street gang and died on the operating table.]<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
