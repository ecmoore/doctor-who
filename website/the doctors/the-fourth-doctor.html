							<p><IMG width="340" height="255" alt="01" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/gallery/fourthdoctor/images/340/01.jpg" border="1">The Fourth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was  portrayed by Tom Baker for seven consecutive seasons and remains the  longest-lived incarnation of the Doctor in the show's on-screen history,  counting both the classic and modern series. Further to this, he is considered  to be the most recognisable incarnations of the Doctor both in the United Kingdom  and internationally.</p>
<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old  Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body, changing his physical appearance and personality in  the process. Baker portrays the fourth such incarnation, a whimsical and  sometimes brooding individual whose enormous personal warmth is at times  tempered by his capacity for righteous anger. His initial companion was  intrepid journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), who had travelled  alongside him in his previous incarnation, and she is later joined by surgeon  Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter). His later companions included robotic dog K-9,  savage alien warrior Leela (Louise Jameson), female Time Lord Romana (Mary Tamm  and Lalla Ward), alien aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), boy genius Adric  (Matthew Waterhouse) and Australian flight attendant Tegan (Janet Fielding).</p>
