							<h2>Patrick Troughton</h2>
                                	<p>The Second Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was  portrayed by character actor Patrick Troughton.</p>
							<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old  Time Lord alien from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality  change.</p>
							<p>The transformation into the Second Doctor (originally  referred to as a &quot;renewal&quot;), a figure who was the same 'essential'  character as the first but with a very different persona, was a turning point  in the evolution of the series, and eventually became a critical element of the  series' longevity.</p>
