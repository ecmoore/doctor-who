Passionate, sometimes quick to anger, this was a Doctor you did not want to make enemies with. He tangled with the corporate greed of the slimy Sil, took H.G. Wells on a trip to a strange world of Morlox and time machines, and defeated the amoral Gallifreyan scientist known only as the Rani. Once again, the Doctor&rsquo;s interference in the affairs of other worlds resulted in a trial by his own people, and his own darker side, &ldquo;The Valeyard&rdquo; â€“ who stood to gain all his remaining incarnations. After uncovering the Valeyard&rsquo;s schemes, all charges were dropped, and the Doctor and Mel headed off in the TARDIS.]<!-- InstanceEndEditable --></td>
