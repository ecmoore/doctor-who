                                	<h1>The Ninth Doctor</h1>
							<h2>Christopher Eccleston</h2>
                                	<p>The Ninth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is  portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's  revival in 2005. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling,  humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically  injured, he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical  appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.</p>
							<p>The production team's approach to the character and  Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from  his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less  eccentric. To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a  primary companion who was designed to be as independent and courageous as  himself in the form of Rose Tyler. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell,  a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions and ultimately  proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con-man from the 51st Century.  The Doctor, Rose, and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series  finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.</p>
