                                	<p>The Eighth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the  protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He is  portrayed by Paul McGann. Until 2013 he had only appeared on television in one  1996 TV film, but his adventures were extensively portrayed in other media in  the years which followed it. McGann reprised the role in a 2013 mini-episode  called &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;, which depicts the last adventure of  the Eighth Doctor.</p>
							<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old  alien, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who travels in time and space in  his TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured,  he can regenerate his body but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and  with it, a distinct new personality. McGann portrays the eighth such  incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only  companion in the television movie is Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook), a  medical doctor whose surgery is responsible for triggering his regeneration. In  the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and  comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including  self-styled &quot;Edwardian Adventuress&quot; Charley, the alien Destrii and  present-day humans Lucie and Sam.</p>
