							<h2>Peter Capaldi </h2>
                                	<p>The twelfth incarnation noted that he had wasted three  incarnations in a very short time span simply because he &quot;forgot to  unplug&quot;. He proved the shortest-lived incarnation, only living long enough  to shut off a zectronic energy generator before being hit by excess zectronic  energy. He immediately died from the exposure. Allegedly, zectronic energy  would kill Time Lords beyond any hope of regeneration. He gave a final speech  to Emma and the Master, asking them to &quot;look after the universe&quot; for  him, as he had &quot;put a lot of work into it&quot;. He promised to explain  later, then died. His foes, the Daleks and the Master, vowed to reform and live  better lives because of him.</p>
