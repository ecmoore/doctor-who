                                	<h1>Davros</h1>
                                	<p>Davros is a scientist from the planet Skaro whose people,  the Kaleds, were engaged in a bitter thousand-year war of attrition with their  enemies, the Thals. He is horribly scarred and crippled, a condition various  spin-off media attribute to his laboratory being attacked by a Thal shell. He  has one functioning hand and one cybernetic eye mounted on his forehead to take  the place of his real eyes, which appear to have been welded shut; for much of  his existence he depends completely upon a self-designed mobile life-support  chair which encloses the lower half of his body. It would become an obvious  inspiration for his eventual design of the Dalek. The condition of the lower  half of his body is unknown; he is physically incapable of leaving the chair  without dying. Davros's voice, like those of the Daleks, is electronically  distorted. His manner of speech is generally soft and contemplative, but when  angered or excited he is prone to ranting outbursts that resemble the  hysterical, staccatissimo speech of the Daleks.</p>
							<p>Davros is a megalomaniac who believes that through his  creations, the Daleks, he can become the supreme being and ruler of the  universe. He is a brilliant, ruthless scientist who has demonstrated mastery of  robotics, mechatronics, metallurgy, chemistry, artificial intelligence,  cloning, genetic engineering, biology, physics, astronomy, earth science, military  tactics, cybernetics and mechanical engineering</p>
