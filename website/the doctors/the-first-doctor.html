                                	<h1>The First Doctor</h1>
							<h2>William Hartnell</h2>
                                	<p>The First Doctor is the initial incarnation of the Doctor,  the protagonist of the BBC television science fiction series Doctor Who. He was  portrayed by the actor William Hartnell from 1963 to 1966. A cinematic version  of the character, Dr. Who, was played in two films (1965 and 1966) by Peter  Cushing. Hartnell reprised the role in the tenth anniversary story The Three  Doctors in 1973 â€“ albeit in a reduced capacity due to his ailing health. In  1983, actor Richard Hurndall played the part of the First Doctor in the 20th  anniversary story The Five Doctors, as William Hartnell had died in 1975.</p>
							<p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old  alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in his  TARDIS, frequently with companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he  can regenerate his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality  change. Hartnell's Doctor is the Doctor's &quot;original&quot; form. The  regeneration plot device was introduced when Hartnell needed to leave the  series, and consequently has extended the life of the show for many years. The  First Doctor is the youngest incarnation of the Doctor, but has the most aged  physical appearance, having grown old through a natural lifespan. The Doctor's  ability to regenerate allows him to appear younger, effectively taking on a new  body that has yet to wear down with age. Respectively, later incarnations would  portray the Doctor with a younger appearance, though his natural age continues  to rise.</p>
